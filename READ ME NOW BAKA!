# Tsundere Linux

Tsundere Linux is an ultra-elitist Linux distribution designed for BAKAS who want complete control over their system. This distribution provides only the GRUB bootloader and a minimal boot environment, leaving all other configurations to the user. Like a true tsundere, Tsundere Linux starts off challenging and demanding, but ultimately rewards users with a fully customized system.
